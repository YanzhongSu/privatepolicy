        <h1>Privacy Policy - Visa Appointment Booking Assistant</h1>
        <p><em>Last updated: 2025-03-20</em></p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The Visa Appointment Booking Assistant is a browser extension designed to help users automate the process of monitoring and booking visa appointments. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data and ensure your privacy.
        </p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            When you visit the visa booking website, the extension will:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Monitor the page for available appointment slots.</li>
            <li>Automatically book an appointment based on your preferences (if enabled).</li>
            <li>Notify you of the booking status or any changes in availability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Data Is Processed</h2>
        <p>
            The extension processes the following data to provide its functionality:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Appointment Details</strong>: Dates, times, and locations of available appointments.</li>
            <li><strong>User Preferences</strong>: Your preferred appointment dates, times, and other settings configured in the extension.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Data Is Saved</h2>
        <p>
            The extension saves the following data locally on your device:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User Preferences</strong>: Your configured settings (e.g., preferred appointment dates and times).</li>
            <li><strong>Appointment Information</strong>: Details of booked or monitored appointments for your reference.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What About Personal Data?</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>No Personal Data Collected</strong>: The extension does not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, or passport details.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>No Tracking Cookies</strong>: The extension does not use tracking cookies or any other means to monitor your browsing activity outside the visa booking website.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            All data processed by the extension is handled locally on your device and is not transmitted to any external servers or third parties.
        </p>
        <p>
            The extension does not have access to sensitive information such as passwords, payment details, or personal identification numbers.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            The extension interacts only with the official visa booking website to monitor and book appointments. It does not integrate with or share data with any third-party services.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and we encourage you to review it periodically.
        </p>
